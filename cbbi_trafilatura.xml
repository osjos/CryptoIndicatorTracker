    <p>CONFIDENCE WE ARE AT THE PEAK:</p>
    <p>Some metrics are disabled.</p>
    <p>CBBI.info</p>
    <p> CBBI is a Bitcoin index utilizing advanced, real-time analysis of 9 metrics to help better understand what stage of the Bitcoin bull run and bear market cycles we are in. The confidence score indicates whether we are approaching the top or bottom of a Bitcoin price cycle. <lb/> The CBBI algorithm and website are 100% open source, making CBBI different from other, closed-source Bitcoin price indexes. CBBI is run by a team of two, Colin and Kamil. We don't serve ads. We don't monetize the website. We don't sell your data. CBBI is truly free. As such, your donations are greatly appreciated! See the bottom of this site for ways you can donate! (We do have to pay our hosting and server costs) <lb/> Please see the FAQ for answers to many common questions regarding the CBBI. </p>
    <p> The CBBI is not investment advice. It intends to be a fun way of looking at long-term price movements, disregarding daily noise in volatility. The CBBI is a relatively new index. As such, use it with caution. <lb/> None of the metrics CBBI uses have experienced a macro economic recession/depression and thus this element is not factored in. More info </p>
    <p>The CBBI Rainbow Line displays the Bitcoin price line using the CBBI score for the color of each point.</p>
